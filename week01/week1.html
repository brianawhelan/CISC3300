		<p>Tim Burner Lee&#39;s article Long live the web discusses how his creation of the world wide web is in great danger and how users should be worried what lies ahead. Lee originally created the World Wide Web so that everyone can openly share information with one another. However, throughout this essay Lee critiques how his original principle of the World Wide Web&#39;s original is being distorted by our modern society. He argues that the world wide web is being threatened because:<p>

		<p>&#34;Large social&#8211;networking sites are walling off information posted by their users from the rest of the Web. Wireless Internet providers are being tempted to slow traffic to sites with which they have not made deals. Governments&#8211;totalitarian and democratic alike&#8211;are monitoring people&#39;s online habits&#44; endangering important human rights.&#34;(pg. 80)

		<p>I found this article to interesting because Lee exhibits the underlying truths about the web today. He stresses the importance of data and how much trackable information we leave on the web. Social media sites&#44; articles we read&#44; what we watch and what we buy is constantly being collected everyday. Essentially&#44; our basic human rights are violated on the internet and we need to work together to preserve our basic digital principles on the world wide web for our future.</p>
