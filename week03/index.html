Comic book artist can make their work realistic, unrealisitic, or surreal cartoon images of people and objects. Mcloud dives into the idealogy behind the language, realistic art, icons and symbols used by comic book artists. He emphasises on the difference between realism and abstract images. Abstract art of cartoons can exhibit simplistics ideas by using straightforward symbols and details. The more simple a comic is, the easier it is to interpet.

		<ol type= "I">
			<li>Word Specific: wheree images don't specifically add to a complete text.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Picture Specific: combinations where words add a "soundtrack" to the image"</li>
			<br>
			<li>Duo-Specific: panels in which both words and pictures send essentially the same message</li>
			<br>
			<li>Additive: combination of words elaborate on an imagee or vice versa</li>
			<br>
			<li>Parellel: combination of words and pictures seem to follow very different courses without interacting</li>
			<br>
			<li>Montage: where words are treated as integral parts of the picturee</li>
